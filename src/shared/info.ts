  about: [
    `Hello, My name is Kenneth, and I'd love challenges, learning trend technologies and programming languages.`,
    `My interest in programming started months after I shifted my course from a BS in Architecture to a BS in Information Technology. When I answered programming activities in our school, I got motivated bit by bit until I roled as a programmer in our Thesis group and developed a sales and inventory system.`,
    `Fast-forward to today, I've gained experience as a developer, and now my main focus these days is learning trending technologies and freelancing while I'm still waiting and looking for an oppurtunity to work in growing companies.`,
